/**

 * (plus any `allow`ed popover it opens) can be clicked or typed into — the
 * coach's guard swallows everything else. Each step shows a short instruction
 * in the coach panel and completes when its `advance` condition is met. After
 * the last step the visitor gets the completion screen: sign up or replay.
